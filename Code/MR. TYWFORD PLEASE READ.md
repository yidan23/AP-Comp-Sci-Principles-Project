The AP CS Principals submission is just for the actual AP submission
- I dont have the best documentation for the creation of the additional code in the AP version

Because of this, The May 7th video and code submission is my submission for the CS2 Seven Hills Submission, where it is a lot simpler, but the documentation process is much better
Thanks!
