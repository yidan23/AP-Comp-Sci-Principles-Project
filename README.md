# CS2-Project

March 10, 2021 - i created this file and started brainstorming ideas for my project. 

March 30, 2021 - familiarized myself with Arduino by creating a simple blinking light script. This allowed me to learn a lot about the syntax for coding in the Arduino IDE, as well as get an understanding for how to go about controlling a servo with an input

April 5, 2021 - experimented with Tinkercad simulation hardware and coding. Specifically, connecting hardware such as Servos, light sensors, and LEDs, to the Arduino motherboard (accounting for resistors as well).

April 7, 2021 - worked in Tinkercad fiddling with the light sensor in which it turns a certain LED on and off based on the light level it input. 

April 9, 2021 - worked in Tinkercad simulation to program a servo motor turn based on the light input of a light sensor. I learned a lot about how servos work and put my CS50 skills to use with creating IF statements and calling functions.
